# Data-Run-Mobile

## Overview

Data-Run-Mobile is a Flutter application developed for the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP)
in Yemen. The app facilitates the submission and synchronization of malaria-related data with the
main backend system, Data-run-Api. This tool is designed to streamline data collection processes and
ensure accurate and timely data transmission to support malaria control efforts.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Download**: The app downloads forms designed on the backend, which can include
  various question types.
- **Question Types**: Supports Text, Number, Date, Multi Answer, Single Answer, Image, and File
  questions.
- **Data Submission**: Users can submit various malaria-related data directly from the app.
- **Data Synchronization**: The app syncs submitted data with the Data-run-Api, ensuring all
  information is up-to-date.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and authentication to ensure data integrity and privacy.
- **User Management**: Quickly create users and assign them to particular teams.
- **Offline Mode**: Allows data entry even when offline; data will be synced once the internet
  connection is restored.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design to facilitate ease of use by healthcare
  workers.

## Installation

To install Data-Run-Mobile on your device, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hamza-ye/datarunmobile.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd data-run-mobile
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

We manage **field activities** involving teams and assignments, where data collection is a core task. Activities may target specific entities such as **locations, health facilities, or people**, and could involve tasks like distributing items (e.g., ITNs, medicines) or supervising teams. Each team has **planned locations** and **allocated quantities** for their assignments.

### **Current Design**:

1. **Assignments**: Link an activity, orgUnit, team, and day.
2. **Activity**: Groups assignments, teams, and tasks within a defined time frame.
3. **Teams**: A "person entity" created before linking a user, allowing assignment distribution. Later, a user can be linked to a person to gain permissions and configurations upon login,
4. **Users**: Store login info (username, password, etc.).
5. **DataForm Templates**: Templates for data collection, varying per team/task, DataForm Templates can be linked to an assignment/ or just a general form to collect data with no particular assignment, when linked they are used to submit data for the assignment progress.
6. **Data Submission**: Stores submitted data linked to teams with context related attributes such as user, team, assignment...etc
--- 

### **Current Approach**

### **Assignments**

- **Definition**:
    
    Assignments link an activity, organization unit (orgUnit), assigned team, day, and a map of dynamic attributes (e.g., `ITNs`, `Population`):
    
    ```json
    { "attributeName": "attributeValue" }
    
    ```
    
    - Assignments are implemented hierarchically, allowing parent-child relationships. For example:
        - **Supervisor Assignment**:
            - **Activity**: ITNs Supervision.
            - **OrgUnit**: District supervised.
            - **Team**: Supervisor team.
            - **StartDay**: 1.
            - **Allocated Resources**: Total district ITNs and population.
        - **Child Assignment**:
            - **Activity**: ITNs Distribution.
            - **OrgUnit**: Village within the district.
            - **Team**: Field distribution team.
            - **StartDay**: 1.
            - **Allocated Resources**: Village ITNs and population.

### **Forms Template and submissions**
- **Templates**:
    - Data collection templates vary based on team or assignment needs.
    - Forms may be general or linked to specific assignments for tracking progress.
- **Submissions**:
    - Store collected data, including metadata like timestamps, GPS coordinates, assignment reference if the template is linked to an assignment, and user identifiers.

1. **Form templates linked to an assignment/task**:
    - Assignments can have one or more **DataForms** linked to it and with the right permission assigned teams/users can access these forms to collect data about the assignment if they have this assignment assigned to them or is a sub assignment of their assignement.
    - Example assignment for a team:
        
        ```json
        {
          "uid": "llm1EHPJ5kh",
          "entityScope": "Assigned",
          "activity": { "uid": "RHl5bdmYXVr" },
          "startDay": 1,
          "orgUnit": { "uid": "HgWpVtC10fF" },
          "team": { "uid": "YFNLJEoYpfy" },
          "allocatedResources": { "ITNs": 899, "Population": 89 },
          "parent": { "uid": "rSBRh6eofeH" },
          "forms": [
            "Tcf3Ks9ZRpB",
            "RtnmK39VXTY"
          ]
        }
        
        ```

## **Goal, Mobile App (First Release)**
### Modular Forms Integration

- Create **Form Templates** that dynamically adapt to the context:
    - Fields can reference **Tasks** or **Assignments** (e.g., `targetedOrgUnit`, `population`, `resourcesUsed`).
    - Some forms are independent of tasks/assignments for surveys or general reporting.
    - Allow flexible linking between forms and entities, enabling progress tracking, summaries, or data validation.

### **Example Configuring ITNs Distribution Campaigns**
**Task**:

```json
{
  "id": "task_001",
  "name": "Distribute ITNs in Village A",
  "description": "Daily path for team A",
  "startDate": "2024-01-01",
  "endDate": "2024-01-01",
  "allocatedResources": ["ITNs"],
  "targetedOrgUnits": ["village_a", "school_b"],
  "metadata": { "population": 1000, "ITNs": 500 }
}

```

**Assignment**:

```json
{
  "id": "assign_001",
  "taskId": "task_001",
  "assignee": "team_a",
  "assignedForms": ["form_001"],
  "status": "active"
}

```

### **Teams**

- **Dynamic Configuration**:
    - Teams can be formed for specific projects and dissolved afterward.
    - Teams are hierarchical, with supervisors managing subordinate teams.
    - teams can be assigned to one or more assignments and a team can manage or report about the assignment of their managed teams
- Example of Team:

```json
{
    "uid": "P5fjmw0elDV",
    "code": "317",
    "name": "team-317",
    "disabled": false,
    "activity": { "uid": "RHl5bdmYXVr" },
    "users": [ { "uid": "qqHQA2BFJJf" } ],
    "assignments": [
        { "uid": "DDl4bimW3Vr" },
        { "uid": "ERT5bd4Y6Vr" }
    ],
    "managedTeams": [],
    "formPermissions": [
        { "form": "form_001", "permissions": ["VIEW_TRACK_SUMMARY"] },
        { "form": "form_002", "permissions": ["ADD_SUBMISSIONS"] }
    ]
}

```

**Form Templates**:

```json
[
    {
    "id": "form_001",
    "name": "assigned location resource distribution data",
    "fields": [
        { "name": "orgUnit", "type": "reference", "ref": "orgUnit" },
        { "name": "resourcesUsed", "type": "number" },
        { "name": "population", "type": "number" },
    ]
    },
    {
    "id": "form_002",
    "name": "teams allocated resource movement transactions",
    "fields": [
        { "name": "orgUnit/centeral wh location", "type": "reference", "ref": "orgUnit" },
        {"id": "transactions", "name": "resource to teams transactions details", "type": "table" , 
        "fields": [
            { "name": "team", "type": "reference", "ref": "managedTeams" },
            { "name": "resourcesDispensedToTeam", "type": "number" }
        ]
       }     
    ]
    }
]
```
